A script to generate a PDF file of images and associated text from the current folder.

All images (matching *.jpg) are added on a separate page.

If a text file exists with the same name, its contents are added under the image.

If the "-t" option is passed, the filename (without extension) is included in place of the text, if no text file is provided.
